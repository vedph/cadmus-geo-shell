# Cadmus Geography Shell

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.0.4.

- [models](https://github.com/vedph/cadmus-geo)
- [API](https://github.com/vedph/cadmus-geo-api)

This shell is used to develop Cadmus frontend geography libraries.

## Docker

üêã Quick Docker image build:

1. `npm run build-lib`;
2. update version in `env.js` and `ng build`;
3. `docker build . -t vedph2020/cadmus-geo-shell:1.0.0 -t vedph2020/cadmus-geo-shell:latest` (replace with the current version).

## Requirements

This requires Leaflet via [ngx-leaflet](https://github.com/bluehalo/ngx-leaflet).

(1) install packages:

```bash
npm install leaflet @asymmetrik/ngx-leaflet
npm install --save-dev @types/leaflet
```

(2) in `angular.json` under `styles` add the leaflet CSS stylesheet:

```json
"styles": [
  "./node_modules/leaflet/dist/leaflet.css"
]
```

(3) manually copy images from `node_modules/leaflet/dist/images` to `src/assets/images`.

(4) import the corresponding module in your root component or module:

```ts
import { LeafletModule } from '@asymmetrik/ngx-leaflet';

...
imports: [
  LeafletModule
]
...
```

## History

- 2024-11-18: updated Angular and packages.

### 4.1.1

- 2024-06-09:
  - updated Angular and packages.
  - added `class="mat-X"` for each `color="X"` (e.g. `class="mat-primary"` wherever there is a `color="primary"`) to allow transitioning to Angular Material M3 from M2. This also implies adding it directly to the target element, so in the case of `mat-icon` inside a `button` with `color` the class is added to `mat-icon` directly (unless the button too has the same color). This allows to keep the old M2 clients while using the new M3, because it seems that the compatibility mixin is not effective in some cases like inheritance of `color`, and in the future `color` will be replaced by `class` altogether.
  - updated to modern control flow syntax.
  - applied M3 theming.
